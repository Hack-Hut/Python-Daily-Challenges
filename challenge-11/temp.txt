Question 11
Level 2

Question:
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Solution:
value = []
items=[x for x in raw_input().split(',')]
for p in items:
    intp = int(p, 2)
    if not intp%5:
        value.append(p)

print ','.join(value)

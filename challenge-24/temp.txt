Question 24
Level 1

Question:
    Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it, you can read document online or find some books. But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.
    Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents, such as abs(), int(), raw_input()
    And add document for your own function
    
Hints:
    The built-in document method is __doc__

Solution:
print abs.__doc__
print int.__doc__
print raw_input.__doc__

def square(num):
    '''Return the square value of the input number.
    
    The input number must be integer.
    '''
    return num ** 2

print square(2)
print square.__doc__

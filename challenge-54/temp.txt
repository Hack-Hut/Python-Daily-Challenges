7.2

Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.

Hints:

To override a method in super class, we can define a method with the same name in the super class.

Solution:

class Shape(object):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        return 0

class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, l):
        Shape.__init__(self)
        self.length = l

    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.length

aSquare= Square(3)
print aSquare.area()

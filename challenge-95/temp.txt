Question:

Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a method "getGender" which can print "Male" for Male class and "Female" for Female class.

Hints:
Use Subclass(Parentclass) to define a child class.

Solution:

class Person(object):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Unknown"

class Male( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Male"

class Female( Person ):
    def getGender( self ):
        return "Female"

aMale = Male()
aFemale= Female()
print aMale.getGender()
print aFemale.getGender()

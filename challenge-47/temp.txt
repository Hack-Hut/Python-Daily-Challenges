Question:
Write a program which can map() and filter() to make a list whose elements are square of even number in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Hints:

Use map() to generate a list.
Use filter() to filter elements of a list.
Use lambda to define anonymous functions.

Solution
li = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
evenNumbers = map(lambda x: x**2, filter(lambda x: x%2==0, li))
print evenNumbers

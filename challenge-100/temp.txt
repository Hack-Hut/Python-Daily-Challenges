Question:

Write a program to solve a classic ancient Chinese puzzle: 
We count 35 heads and 94 legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm. How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have?

Hint:
Use for loop to iterate all possible solutions.

Solution:

def solve(numheads,numlegs):
    ns='No solutions!'
    for i in range(numheads+1):
        j=numheads-i
        if 2*i+4*j==numlegs:
            return i,j
    return ns,ns

numheads=35
numlegs=94
solutions=solve(numheads,numlegs)
print solutions
